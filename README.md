Amalgamation WordPress Theme
===

Built on Underscores, this will start life as a theme for my web development blog to augment it into a central hub for my multiple online presences so I have a single place I can, say, put on business cards that I might give to anyone regardless of reason. I hope to flesh it out afterward with more customization plus thorough translatability for submission to the WordPress theme repository.

Front page: Template with four panels, three of which show excerpts from pages of the website (support added in theme) and one of which shows excerpts of the latest blog post. Show in two columns of two panels on wide enough screens and a single column of four when more narrow. Title and tagline at top, line with copyright and credits at bottom. Later, user can specify the kind of content in each panel (in addition to which pages to excerpt), possibly including widgetized areas.

Interior pages: Simple and clean. Title, tagline, and menu at the top, single column down, widgetized footer with copyright/credits line at bottom.

Intended theme tags prior to my use:
brown, white, light, featured-images, sticky-post, threaded-comments, one-column, two-columns, full-width-template, fluid-layout, responsive-layout, accessibility-ready

(if you're reading this and know theme tags: is full-width-template appropriate for a one-column design? does my 2x2-panel static page template indicate the tag two-columns?)

Add-ons before theme directory submission:
custom-colors, rtl-language-support, theme-options, translation-ready
